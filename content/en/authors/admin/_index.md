    summary: |
      Handong University's big data camp carried out a team project using LLM models.
      I was in charge of the front end in that team project.
      After fine-tuning the EEVE model using the 'Hiring Interview Interview Data' provided by the AI hub site, our team produced a website called 'Interview Question Maker'.
      Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the website's front end was built, XMLHttpRequest was used to send user input data to the backend server, and the response of the EEVE model received from the server was displayed on the website in real time.
