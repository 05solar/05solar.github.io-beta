abstract: After learning Stack, Chanwoo fell in love with the data structure subject. Chanwoo, who resolved to look only at the data structure subject, randomly stacked the N textbooks for the rest of the subjects into M piles in the corner of the room. However, as the midterm exam approached, I could no longer study only the data structure, and in the end, Chanwoo tries to organize and list the textbooks for the rest of the subjects in number order. Each of the N textbooks is numbered from 1 to N. Chanwoo can only take out the textbooks at the top of each stack, and he must list them in order of number because he must list themâ€¦ Textbooks N-1$ and N must be taken out in order. If you can't list textbooks correctly, let's write a program for Chanwoo who wants to give up his midterm studies.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: I thought it was a problem to solve it, but if I think it's a problem.It was solved by checking whether it is aligned in order to inspect the inner cream car
